Hi! My name is Manish Bellani. I’m a Software Engineer with over 20 years of experience designing and building large-scale distributed systems across many companies, most recently at GitHub. Over the past few years, I've worked on [Blackbird](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-code-search-is-generally-available/), a high-performance code search engine built from the ground up in Rust.

I thrive on tackling deep technical challenges—from building and debugging distributed systems to optimizing performance at scale. Throughout my career, I’ve focused on creating tools that directly enhance developer productivity and drive meaningful impact.

I am currently taking a break from work to focus on health and the well-being of my family. I am also following my love for learning and personal growth by pursuing an [M.Sc.in Software Engineering](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-software-engineering) at Oxford. I’ll soon be exploring my next role, eager to apply my skills and continue growing professionally.

I really enjoy building with Rust, though I’ve also worked extensively with languages like Go, Java, and Python. I’ll admit—I’m fascinated by all things AI. Although I don’t buy into all the hype, I’ve gradually shifted from being a skeptic to recognizing that AI can greatly enhance productivity if used correctly!

I live in Frisco, TX with my wife, Yukta, and our two kids, Mann and Rish—our very own team of four, complete with chaos, laughter, and the occasional missing sock. When I’m not working or studying, you’ll usually find me driving Rish to his cricket games or tossing balls in our backyard cricket cage to help him sharpen his batting skills.

I also enjoy gardening—at least when it’s not the peak of summer in Texas! On top of that, I’m an avid real estate investor, steadily growing my portfolio over time. Thanks for stopping by!
